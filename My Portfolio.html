                <p class="metext"> In addition to those skills, I'm constantly evolving and becoming more amazing. For instance, during the past five years I have learned to play the cello. That's pretty neat!
                    Another thing that I enjoy is that batman movies, they are quite cool. That's why I made the background to this page batman! I also like playing sports such as volleyball, soccer,
                    lacrosse, and other such things. Here's some fun trivia, I have eleven people in my family. I have lots of cousins too! Speaking of cousins, one time my cousin showed my a funny video
                    and I laughed really hard. Wowza, what a funny story! Here's the video:

                    I was born on November 1st, the day after Halloween. I was born in Utah, which is pretty lame. I really like Hawaii and would like to go there this summer. I also really like food, like doughnuts
                    and other food. I can do a back flip, so that's pretty cool. I think I need to take a web design class, because I put that youtube video in a weird place, and it looks awkward; but I don't know
                    where else I'd put it. I would like to learn how to do a wall flip, but I don't know where to start. Flips in general are pretty hard to learn because you can't really mess up or else you hurt
                    yourself pretty bad. Once when I was a little kid I decided I was going to try and do a front flip, so I put down a pillow and did a front flip. However, I didn't make it and landed on my back,
                    it didn't feel especially good.

                    More recently I was at this trampoline place and I was doing a trick and didn't make it off the tramp into the foam pit. Instead, I landed on the corner of the tramp,
                    that didn't feel especially good either. You may be thinking, "Wow this guy is super random and really into tramps!", but I'm not really that into flips and stuff I just need to fill up this space and
                    that's just what I was thinking about. Also one time my English teacher asked everybody to write a page about themselves, and everybody else wrote these really deep and depressing papers. Meanwhile I
                    wrote this paper on how I thought he looked like Iron Man and how I liked doughnuts, and from then on whenever I write a paper about myself I try and make it pretty light...and I usually mention doughnuts.
