    <h1> This is an informational page about me</h1>

        <p class="myparagraph anotherclass"> My name is Sam Robertson. I am the last of nine kids. I have played the cello for five years. I used to play soccer, lacrosse, and I enjoy playing volleyball. I like bacon and doughnuts, but not bacon doughnuts. One time me and my friend decided to practice doing boost flips so that we could do one at a dance. Then one day we went to a dance and did it, and it was dope!</p>
        <p class="myparagraph italics"> Some of my favorite animals include flamingos, foxes, and raptors. I am Iron man's closest relative because we have the same chest. One time I was hanging out with my friends and came up with the name Sam the Immortal Raptor, so that's how I'm going to sign this page.</p>
        <div> Here is an informational page about raptors: <a href="http://www.livescience.com/23922-velociraptor-facts.html"> The best raptor page!</a></div>
