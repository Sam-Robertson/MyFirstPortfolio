                <p> Bacon is a meat product prepared from pork and usually cured.[1][2] It is first cured using large quantities of salt,[2] either in a brine or in a dry packing;
                    the result is fresh bacon (also known as green bacon).[3] Fresh bacon may then be further dried for weeks or months in cold air, or it may be boiled or smoked.[1]
                    Fresh and dried bacon
                    is typically cooked before eating, often by frying. Boiled bacon is ready to eat, as is some smoked bacon, but may be cooked further before eating.</p>
                <p>Meat from other animals, such as beef, lamb, chicken, goat, or turkey, may also be cut, cured, or otherwise prepared to resemble bacon, and may even be referred to as "bacon".
                    [7] Such use is common in areas with significant Jewish and Muslim populations, both of which prohibit the consumption of pigs.
                    [8] The USDA defines bacon as "the cured belly of a swine carcass"; other cuts and characteristics must be separately qualified (e.g., "smoked pork loin bacon").
                    For safety, bacon may be treated to prevent trichinosis,[9] caused by Trichinella, a parasitic roundworm which can be destroyed by heating, freezing, drying, or smoking.[10]

                </p>
                <p> Bacon is distinguished from salt pork and ham by differences in the brine (or dry packing). Bacon brine has added curing ingredients, most notably sodium nitrite,
                    and occasionally potassium nitrate (saltpeter); sodium ascorbate or erythorbate are added to accelerate curing and stabilise colour.
                    Flavourings such as brown sugar or maple are used for some products. Sodium polyphosphates, such as sodium triphosphate, may be added to make the produce easier to slice and
                    to reduce spattering when the bacon is pan-fried. Today, a brine for ham, but not bacon,
                    includes a large amount of sugar. Historically, "ham" and "bacon" referred to different cuts of meat that were brined or packed identically, often together in the same barrel.</p>
                <p> This program is designed to give students the skills needed to be a Junior-Level Web Developer. Students will learn basic Front End Development including IDE, Basic OS,
                    Source Control, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Troubleshooting. Students will then spend the majority of the program learning JavaScript and Angular JS. The remainder of the program
                    will cover Back-End Development as it relates to Back End Servers, Database, LESS/CSS, Hosting, Deployment, Security and Automated QA. Finally, students will complete a 240 hour
                    externship at Xactware. Throughout the program students will do a series of Professional Portfolio projects that will enable them to have a working portfolio when they complete
                    the program.  For more program information please visit:  http://mlatc.edu/programs/web-programming-development/</p>
